For my project i created a guessing game where the player has to guess on a 16 square grid 5 consecutive times without clicking 3 losing squares. After running the program the algorithm is going to run the Player.getmouse() to wait to player to click inside the window on 1 of 16 boxes after it will verify with a if/elif statement the position where it was clicked and where it will check if it was one of the winning winning else one of the losing squares if a winning square was clicked it will fill the box green and the process will go again until the player clicks a losing box or clicks 5 times in a row the winning boxes. If the player clicks 5 consecutive times the window will clear and a winning message will show and if the player clicks any losing box the window will also clear showing a losing message.
Also this project is made with functions only in project02 and is also implemented with classes in project03.
